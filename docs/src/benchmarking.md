# Benchmarking WAVI

WAVI uses `BenchmarkTools.jl` to produce indicative results. 

To get off the ground, clone the repo and go to the `/benchmarks/` folder. Instantiate the environment and then run any one of the following scripts:

* run_sim_benchmarks

## run_sim_benchmarks

At present, we're looking at the change in performance across permutation of the following parameters of a dummy simulation:

* Threading and distribution strategy
* Grid densities

## schwarz_testing
